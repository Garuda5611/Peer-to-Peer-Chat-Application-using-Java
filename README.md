# Peer-to-Peer-Chat-Application-using-Java
I have created Peer to Peer chat application using java. I have used java.net package for developing this project. User has to use two command prompts as windows one as server other as client once connection is established they can chat with each other. I have also provided security to app that without connection they cannot chat.
